# Public-ScriptRepository
Public Non-sensitive scripts that I've made/adjusted for self-use or for someone else.

I'm not a developer and I usually stop working scripts once they function as intended - so don't expect professional level scripts.

Appreciate input on improvements through issues + pull-requests.
