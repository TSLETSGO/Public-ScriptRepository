# Public-ScriptRepository
Non-sensitive scripts that I've made/adjusted made for home use, either for myself or someone else.

Always open to learn, so if you have any suggestions I appreciate input on improvements through issues or pull-requests.

# Use at own risk!
I'm not a developer and I usually stop working scripts once they function as intended.
